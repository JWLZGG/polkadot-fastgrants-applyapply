# üìù StarkBTC Light Client

## üåü Project Overview

Please provide the following:

Tagline: Bringing trustless Bitcoin state to Polkadot and Substrate-based chains.

This project is a Rust-based Bitcoin light client that performs simplified payment verification (SPV), enabling any Substrate chain to access verifiable Bitcoin state without relying on custodians or oracles. It lays the foundation for integrating Bitcoin into Polkadot-native DeFi, payments and cross-chain tooling ‚Äî with zk-STARK trace export as a future extension.

-Relation to Polkadot:

Built in Rust with direct compatibility for integration into Substrate-based parachains.

Enables any chain in the Polkadot ecosystem to verify Bitcoin transactions natively.

Potential to bridge Bitcoin to chains like Acala, Interlay, or Moonbeam for real-world DeFi use.

Why we're building it:
Wrapped BTC is centralised and exposes users to custodial risk. Our project aims to remove this bottleneck and offer a cryptographic alternative: trust-minimized Bitcoin validation inside Polkadot.

### üîç Project Details

We expect applicants to have a solid idea about the project's expected final state. Therefore, please submit (where relevant):

### Technology Stack:
### Language: Rust

### Core Library: rust-bitcoin for parsing headers and transactions

Merkle Proofs + Header Chain Verification: Custom logic

CLI Interface: Rust-based command-line interface

Optional Future Export: zk-STARK proof compatibility via Cairo (Starknet) or zkLLVM

Optional API layer: JSON-RPC or GraphQL endpoint for Polkadot integration 

- Architecture Overview:

Wallet Layer: Generates a Bitcoin keypair, tracks UTXOs, and crafts transactions

Header Sync: Verifies PoW difficulty and chains valid Bitcoin block headers

Merkle Proof Verification: Given a txid, validates inclusion in a known block

STARK Export (Milestone 2): Optional module to export transaction verification trace

Substrate Compatibility: Modularised output format for potential parachain or off-chain worker consumption

### Proof of Concept / Prior Work:

 wallet-gen-working: Keypair generation and basic CLI wallet in Rust (GitHub tagged)

 Merkle verification and header chain logic in active development

Notion teaser and pitch deck already circulated with VC interest from a16z-aligned scouts

Designed with extensibility for ZK verification and cross-chain compatibility

### UI/UX Components:
UI is TBD; however the initial version is CLI-based for simplicity. Potential API layer may support UI in later stages.

### Data Models / API Specifications of the Core Functionality
This is minimal for now since the MVP is CLI-based, but we're defining key structs and potential future API behaviour:
Internal Rust Structs (planned or implemented):

```struct Wallet {
    pubkey: bitcoin::PublicKey,
    utxos: Vec<UTXO>,
}

struct UTXO {
    txid: bitcoin::Txid,
    vout: u32,
    value: u64,
    script_pubkey: bitcoin::Script,
}

struct HeaderChain {
    headers: Vec<bitcoin::BlockHeader>,
}

struct MerkleProof {
    txid: bitcoin::Txid,
    proof: Vec<bitcoin::hashes::sha256d::Hash>,
    merkle_root: bitcoin::TxMerkleNode,
    position: u32,
}

### Optional JSON-RPC or REST API (future module):

```GET /wallet/balance
Response: { "address": "bc1...", "balance": 120000 }

POST /tx/proof
Body: { "txid": "abc123...", "block_hash": "def456..." }
Response: { "valid": true, "proof": [...], "root": "..." }

GET /headers/latest
Response: { "height": 845921, "hash": "0000..." } ```

This minimal structure supports wallet operations, block syncing and Merkle inclusion proofs. If integrated into a parachain or off-chain worker, this API can expose verifiable BTC state to Polkadot apps.

### What the project is not (for now):

 Not a full validating Bitcoin node

 Does not support full Taproot / Schnorr script execution

 No full-fledged bridge mechanism implemented (this is infra for others to build on)

 Not intended to custody or wrap BTC itself ‚Äî we verify its state only

 ### Expectations / Clarified Limitations
The project does not aim to replace full Bitcoin nodes ‚Äî it offers a lightweight and trust-minimised alternative for verifying key aspects of Bitcoin state.

No real BTC will be bridged or held; we are verifying proof, not facilitating transfer or custody.

zk-STARK export is exploratory and modular, not guaranteed in Milestone 1 (but will be defined clearly in Milestone 2).

The tool relies on public APIs for initial data fetching (e.g., Electrum, Blockstream). Future improvements could add P2P modules.

While designed with interoperability in mind, integrations (e.g. Acala, Interlay) will depend on demand and partnership traction.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
This light client allows Polkadot-based applications (e.g. parachains or off-chain workers) to verify Bitcoin state (e.g. UTXOs, tx inclusion) without needing a full Bitcoin node. It lays the groundwork for trust-minimized BTC integrations ‚Äî including payment rails, oracle-free price feeds, and BTC-based DeFi on Polkadot.

### Who is your target audience?

Builders on Polkadot needing non-custodial BTC data access

DeFi protocols and parachains seeking Bitcoin collateral (e.g. Acala, Interlay)

Oracles and off-chain workers that want verifiable BTC proofs without depending on third-party infrastructure

Security-conscious dApps needing zero-trust state validation

### What need(s) does your project meet?

Enables trustless Bitcoin state access on Substrate-based chains

Reduces reliance on custodial bridges like wBTC

Opens paths for BTC-backed lending, payments, staking

Provides developer tooling for those needing SPV proofs, Merkle verification or lightweight header sync

### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?
Yes ‚Äî projects like Interlay offer BTC-pegged assets (iBTC), but they rely on vaults and bridging mechanisms. There are no lightweight SPV-based Bitcoin clients intended for integration with off-chain workers, zk-bridges, or runtime modules today.

### If so, how is your project different?

We focus on verifiability, not custodianship

No vaults, oracles or bridge dependencies

It's designed to be integrated modularly into parachains, zk-apps or cross-chain protocols

Enables proof export for ZK/STARK-based bridging or attestation use cases

### If not, why might such a project not exist yet?

Historically, Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO model and proof format are harder to integrate with smart contract chains

Most BTC integrations have focused on custodial bridging, which introduces centralization

Recent advances in zk infrastructure, off-chain workers and modular clients have now made this approach viable

## üîÆ Future Plans

**Continued Development**
Following the Fast-Grant, we plan to:

Complete and productionize the Bitcoin light client with full header sync, inclusion proof verification and interoperability modules (e.g., JSON-RPC, Substrate pallet bindings).

Begin implementation of STARK-verifiable proof generation for Bitcoin state, enabling zk-friendly cross-chain integrations.

Explore a browser-based or mobile-compatible light client version for front-end dApps and wallets.

**Additional Funding Plans**
We are actively preparing a pre-seed funding round (~$300K‚Äì350K) to:

Support continued development over a 12‚Äì18 month runway.

Hire 2‚Äì3 key team members (including a co-founder, protocol engineer, and product/UX designer).

Fund a professional security audit (~$35K) and cover legal incorporation costs.

This project has already drawn interest from ecosystem-aligned investors and scouts (e.g., a16z network, European web3 VCs), and we intend to pursue additional public grants from:

Web3 Foundation long-form grants,

HRF‚Äôs Bitcoin Development Fund,

ZK-focused research funds.

**Vision for Polkadot Ecosystem Impact**
We envision Starkle as a foundational Bitcoin <-> Polkadot bridging primitive that:

Enables trust-minimised Bitcoin integration into parachains and dApps without relying on custodians.

Supports new BTC-native DeFi protocols on Polkadot, using verifiable balances and proof-based state tracking.

Lays the groundwork for future zk-light clients and optimistic message passing across ecosystems.

Ultimately, Starkle expands the design space for multi-chain applications by making Bitcoin interoperable, composable and provable within Polkadot and beyond.
